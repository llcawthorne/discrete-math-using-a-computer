# Discrete Mathematics Using a Computer #

This houses the Stdm software that accompanies the *Discrete Mathematics Using a Computer* textbook
from <http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jtod/discrete-mathematics/>.  I may end up saving some scratchwork
to the repo also from my reading of the book.  The [Stdm.lhs](Stdm.lhs) file is the only code provided
on the Discrete Mathematics Using a Computer homepage.  It's a pretty neat example of a Haskell program
that is a proof checker and couple of thousand line literate Haskell example.
